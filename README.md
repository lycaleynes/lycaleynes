<h2> 👋🏻 About me:</h2>

Hi there! My name is Lyconia but I prefer to be called Lyca. If you're unsure how to say it, it’s pronounced <i>Lie</i>—like when someone isn’t telling the truth—and <i>Ka</i>. I know it can be tricky for some people, so don’t even worry about it if you get it wrong! <br/><br/>A little about me: I come from the beautiful and culturally rich islands of the Philippines. Growing up there shaped so much of who I am today. In 2021, right in the midst of the chaotic COVID pandemic, I made the big move to the United States. It was a challenging transition, to say the least. Adjusting to a completely new environment during such a turbulent time wasn’t easy, but over time, I’ve found my footing and connected with people who bring joy and positivity into my life. <br/><br/>Ever since I was young, I’ve always had a fascination with technology. Whether it was tinkering with gadgets or exploring how things worked, that curiosity stayed with me as I grew older. It’s what led me to pursue a career in Cybersecurity—a field where I can combine my passion for technology with the opportunity to protect and innovate.
